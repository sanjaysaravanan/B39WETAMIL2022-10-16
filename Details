    callback function ---> a function which is used an arguement to another function to execute a set of statements

    async operations execution ( operation running in background )
      Eg: setTimout ( wait for sometime to execute ) , setInterval ( executes frequently after certain interval )
    
    async operations are put into a queue after the wait time/ or completion of action.
    then js grabs them from the queue for execution

    use & purpose of the callback

    callback advantages:
      1. Readability
      2. Modularity / Reusability
      3. To keep track when to execute what statements as a callback in a asynchronous operation
